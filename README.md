# Factorial-of-a-Number-using-8086
8086 assembly language projects developed and debugged using DOSBox

# Aim:
To write and execute Assembly Language Programs to perform factorial  of given number for the 8086 microprocessor.

# Software required:
* Personal Computer with MASM Software

# Algorithm:

1. **Start** the program and initialize the data segment.
2. **Load** the input number from memory into a register.
3. **Set** the accumulator to 1 to store the factorial result.
4. **Repeat multiplication** of the accumulator by the number, decrementing the number each time until it becomes 1.
5. **Store and display** the final factorial result, then **end** the program.

# Program:




# Manual calculation:


# Output:


# Result:
Thus, the Assembly Language Programs for 8086 to perform addition of 5 numbers was successfully written and executed using MASM.
